# Food Delivery Simulation

This is a phonebook design and implementation using Trie data structure. I have implemented two tries here. 
1. One uses the name to store details and number at the end.
1. Other uses the number to store details and name at the end.

The implementation supports Prefix Searchingthat displays contact details with a common prefix up to query string length on both name and number of the contact.
